    <!-- AngularJS expressions can be written inside double braces: {{ expression }}.

AngularJS expressions can also be written inside a directive: ng-bind="expression".

AngularJS will resolve the expression, and return the result exactly where the expression is written.

AngularJS expressions are much like JavaScript expressions: They can contain literals, operators, and variables.

Example {{ 5 + 5 }} or {{ firstName + " " + lastName }}
-->

<div ng-init="myCol='lightblue'">
<h3>You can change the background color by typing in a different color name. THis is using ng-model to 
    put the value of the input box into the background-color css property of the input box. 
</h3>
<input style="background-color:{{myCol}}" ng-model="myCol" value="{{myCol}}">
<!-- this uses ng-model to set a css property of an element on the page 
inputting a different color in the input box will dynamically change the
background color-->
</div>

<div ng-init="quantity=1;cost=5">
<!-- angular will operate with numbers just like JS does, completeing any operations and outputting the answer -->
<h3>Using ng-init to set values of vars and then use them in double moustache {{ }} notation. This is the output 
    of {{ quantity * cost }} where quantity has been set to 1 and cost to 5.
</h3>
<p>Total in dollar: {{ quantity * cost }}</p>

</div>

<!-- the same as the exmaple above but using ng-bind insteand of the double moustache notation -->
<div ng-init="quantity=1;cost=5">
<h3>Same as above, but using ng-bing instead of double moustache {{ }} notation.</h3>
<p>Total in dollar: <span ng-bind="quantity * cost"></span></p>

</div>
