    <!-- AngularJS expressions can be written inside double braces: {{ expression }}.

AngularJS expressions can also be written inside a directive: ng-bind="expression".

AngularJS will resolve the expression, and return the result exactly where the expression is written.

AngularJS expressions are much like JavaScript expressions: They can contain literals, operators, and variables.

Example {{ 5 + 5 }} or {{ firstName + " " + lastName }}

    <div ng-init="myCol='lightblue'">
        <h3>You can change the background color of the text box below by typing in a different color name. This is using ng-model to put the value
            of the input box into the background-color css property of the input box.
        </h3>
        <input style="background-color:{{myCol}}" ng-model="myCol" value="{{myCol}}">
        <!-- this uses ng-model to set a css property of an element on the page 
inputting a different color in the input box will dynamically change the
background color-->
    </div>

    <div ng-init="quantity=1;cost=5">
        <!-- angular will operate with numbers just like JS does, completeing any operations and outputting the answer -->
        <h3>Using ng-init to set values of vars and then use them in double moustache {{ }} notation. This is the output of {{
            quantity * cost }} where quantity has been set to 1 and cost to 5.
        </h3>
        <p>Total in dollar: {{ quantity * cost }}</p>

    </div>

    <!-- the same as the exmaple above but using ng-bind insteand of the double moustache notation -->
    <div ng-init="quantity=1;cost=5">
        <h3>Same as above, but using ng-bind instead of double moustache {{ }} notation.</h3>
        <p>Total in dollar: <span ng-bind="quantity * cost"></span></p>

    </div>

    <!-- AngularJS handles strings in the same way as JS does -->
    <div ng-init="firstName='Mr.';lastName='Echo'">
        <h3>You can use strings in AngularJS expressions just like you would in JS. This is the output of The name is {{ firstName
            + " " + lastName }}</h3>
        <p>The name is {{ firstName + " " + lastName }}</p>
    </div>

    <!-- same thing using ng-bind instead of the double moustaches -->
    <div ng-app="" ng-init="firstName='Mr.';lastName='Echo'">
        <h3>Same thing using ng-bind instead of the double moustaches. This is the output of "ng-bind=firstName + ' ' + lastName"</h3>
        <p>The name is <span ng-bind="firstName + ' ' + lastName"></span></p>

    </div>
    <!-- you can access properties of objects using .notation just like you would in JS -->
    <div ng-init="person={firstName:'Mr.',lastName:'Echo'}">
        <h3>You can access properties of objects in AngularJS using .notation like you do in JS this is using person.lastName
            in double moustaches.</h3>
        <p>The name is {{ person.lastName }}</p>

    </div>
    <!-- again, you can use ng-bind instead of the {{ }} and get the same result -->
    <div>
        <h3>you can use ng-bind instead of the double moustaches and get the same result</h3>
        <p>The name is <span ng-bind="person.lastName"></span></p>

    </div>
</body>
<!-- you can access data in arrays in the same way you would in JS -->
<div ng-init="points=['Chuck Roast','Tomatos','Rosemary','Onions','Carrots']">
<h3>Accessing data in arrays works the same as it does in JS</h3>
<p>The third entry in the array is {{ points[2] }}</p>

</div>
<!-- and you can use ng-bind insteac of {{ }} and get the same result -->
<div>
<h3>And you can use ng-bind instead of the double moustaches and get the same result</h3>
<p>The third entry in the array is <span ng-bind="points[2]"></span></p>

<!-- Like JavaScript expressions, AngularJS expressions can contain literals, operators, and variables.

Unlike JavaScript expressions, AngularJS expressions can be written inside HTML.

AngularJS expressions do not support conditionals, loops, and exceptions, while JavaScript expressions do.

AngularJS expressions support filters, while JavaScript expressions do not. -->
